Welcome to the "Roadtrip" project! This project consists of a website with front-end technologies such as HTML, CSS, and JavaScript, and a back-end using Django. With Roadtrip, you can easily buy tickets online or even rent a car. The user-friendly interface and intuitive design make it easy to navigate and use the system. Roadtrip gives you the opportunity to compare all of the possible options and choose the best suitable transportation service for your trip.
